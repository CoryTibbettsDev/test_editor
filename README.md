# Test Editor
A very simple text editor written in C++  <br>
Data structure is a vector of strings  <br>

I have provided many links below if you have stumbled upon this repo and want to build your own text editor  <br>
Most of the links below are centered around C or C++ however I have included a few which are meant for Rust  <br>
Windows many not work with many of these solutions however macOS should work with many as a Unix system  <br>
